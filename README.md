# LeafletJS-Metro-Map
A simple proposal for Warsaw Metro Line, created for GIS introductory classes.

A map that showcases existing Metro lines and sections under constructions (as for year 2020).
I have added my propositions for future development and creation of next lines.
My predictions were based on 2019 population density heatmap, created by Oficial Warsaw city portal,
and 1927, 1938 metro plans.
